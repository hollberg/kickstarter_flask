# Kickstarter Success Predicter

Lambda School - DS UNIT 4 Build Week Project

This application predicts the likelihood of whether or not a kickstarter campaign will achieve its funding goals based on the input of the customer. There are many factors that can contribute to the likelihood of success for a campaign. For this experiment in soothsaying, though, we kept our scope at the user defined inputs and how they can affect the outcome of their campaign. 

Try it for yourself [here](https://ft-kickstarter-2.herokuapp.com/)!
